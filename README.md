# smoke-detection-in-packet-tracer

In this project I present a Home Automation system (HAS) using Cisco Packet Tracer that employs the integration of cloud networking, wireless communication, to provide the user with remote control of various lights, fans, and appliances within their home and storing the data in the cloud. The system will automatically change based on sensorsâ€™ data. This system is designed to be low cost and expandable allowing a variety of devices to be controlled.
